# Snake Game in Python (Tkinter)

This is a basic implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python's built-in tkinter module. The game includes real-time score tracking, food generation, and collision detection.

## Features

- Snake grows as it eats food
- Game over on wall or self-collision
- Score display
- Keyboard arrow key controls

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (preferably Python 3.6 or higher)

## How to Run

Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/satvikaj/snake-game.git
   cd snake-game

Run the Game:

python snake_game.py
(Make sure the filename is snake_game.py. Rename it if needed.)

**Controls**

Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction:

⬅ Left Arrow - Move Left

➡ Right Arrow - Move Right

⬆ Up Arrow - Move Up

⬇ Down Arrow - Move Down

**Game Rules**

The snake moves continuously in the current direction.

Eating food increases the snake's length and your score.

The game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.
